## Planning

**Brainstorm:** 

*Choose a specific theme*

**Ideas:** Uni students, plant shop, mathematics problem 

**Final idea:** Uni Students

**Quick summary:**

A group of university students studying Mathematics at both the bachelors and masters levels have just been given their schedule for their new term. 

You task is to determine what day of the week they have algebra or calculus and if they are a bachelors or masters student. Their schedule is based on the letter/number parameter criteria below:

B means bachelors student 
M means masters student 

A means algebra
C means calculus 

1-5 determines the day of the week with 1 being Monday and 5 being Friday. 

EX: BA5: Bachelors student with Algebra on Fridays.
