/**
 * Hello newbie! 
 * 
 * You have just been hired as the student coordinator at MIT's Mathematic's department. 
 * You've been given random codes that signify the upcoming term's schedule for
 * bachelor's and master's students taking either algebra or calculus.  
 * 
 * You task is to write a function to determine which day of the week they have algebra or calculus and if they are a bachelor's or master's student. 
 * Their schedule is based on the letter/number parameter criteria below:
 * 
 * B means bachelor's student 
 * M means master's student 
 * 
 * A means algebra
 * C means calculus 
 * 
 * 1-5 determines the day of the week with 1 being Monday and 5 being Friday. 
 * 
 * Example: "BA5" returns bachelors student with algebra on fridays. 
 * 
 * Your function will include two parameters 
 * 1) Student Name
 * 2) Schedule Code (in random order)
 * 
 * Your function must return a sentence like this: 
 *  - "Annamaria is a master's student with calculus on Mondays" 
 *  - "Socrates is a bachelor's student with algebra on Fridays" 
 * 
 * Good luck on your first day! 
 *
